###Questions
- Does the population **explore collectively**? Is the population level rate of exploration a sublinear multiplum of the average individual exploration rate?
- Can we show that single-user models for prediction consistently fails when users explore, but that a large coupled multitask prediction model doesn't because it allows users to explore within commonly shared locations?
